	<h2>Mechanics as a Literary Device</h2>
		<p>Board and card games are narrative devices. Proceeding from
			point to point games unfold along a linear timeline, beginning to
			end, marking progress with keystone events. These events are
			constructed in the mediated ground between player choices and game
			mechanics. It is the goal of mechanics to provide framework around
			which player choices are made. A clearer understanding this is
			obtained through deconstructing the concept of "game". Ultimately all
			games are interactive systems designed to create intriguing choices
			for players. Decisions are reinforced through game mechanics by

			rewarding positive choices and punishing negative. Subsequently the
			goal of the player becomes to efficiently navigate the system by
			making correct choices, or risk facing punishment from the same
			mechanics. Through the mechanics of punishment and reward, choices
			are made and games progress. Narration, a story based on an

			interpretation of game events, results from this series of stimulus
			and reaction repeated to conclusion.</p>
		<p>Game mechanics are not the sole provider of stimuli; other
			players can create similar prompts necessitating reaction. This is
			the primary difference between games in which players work together
			versus against each other. Regardless of the stimuli's source each
			"game" is an evolving narrative event which a player reads through
			experience. Oftentimes games provide flavor reinforcing the desired
			narrative experience. Much of the play experience comes from system
			design choices, including the source of conflict in a game:
			opponents, mechanics, or both. In Third Age, a combat game, other
			players simulate opponents in combat. This is not appropriate for a
			game such as Pandemic or Shadows Over Camelot in which designers seek
			to reinforce cooperation. Subsequent mechanical designs reinforces
			teamwork over competition. Player experience is subsequently shaped
			through mechanics.</p>
	<h2>Systems and "the Feel"</h2>
		<p>Game design is about crafting an experience. Mechanics and art
			work together to give a game it's "feel". All design choices must be
			held against the desired emotional outcome. Visual art explicitly
			depicts flavor dictating aesthetics. Art acts as an immersion point
			for mechanics, building player expectations for the systems. Where
			artists ask the question "what does the game look like?" systems
			designers must ask "how does the game feel?". Art must make sense
			visually just as systems must make sense metaphorically. For example
			many games utilize randomizing systems. These systems simulate

			unpredictable factors requiring players attention. In Third Age,
			randomization of decks creates an unstable play environment
			simulating the chaos of a battlefield. Systems stand in place for
			greater events, events often impossible for an individual to
			experience outside of symbolic representation. In the end games exist
			as simulated systems designed to elicit emotional responses through
			play experience.</p>
	<h2>Physical Games and Interpretation</h2>
		<p>The use of systems in physical games differs widely from their
			usage in video games. In both, systems act as metaphor simulating
			experience. Due to the greater possible scope of video games numerous
			systems can be included in one work. This creates the potential for
			both a greater number of and more complex simulations. Furthermore,

			thanks to the capability for explicit graphical content video games
			rely more visual representations than their physical companions. More
			complex and a greater number of systems coupled with intense visual
			representation means these games possess greater potential for player
			immersion.</p>
		<p>As the book stands against the astounding visual spectacle of
			the film, so too do physical games stand against video games.
			Metaphor and inference to experience is conveyed in more abstract
			ways creating room for individual interpretation. Stated another way,
			board and card games act as prompts for the imagination. By creating

			a playspace that is inherently vague players have a wider degree of
			mobility when interacting with mechanics and flavor. In a similar way
			books also act as prompts for the imagination. Books weave stories
			highly personalized by the individual as they read, decode, and
			interpret the text for themselves. On the other hand, video games
			limit personal interaction through their explicit representation of
			systems and flavor. Similarly films and television allow for little
			individual experience; image after image flashes in front of the
			viewer, dialogue plays out, and plot unfolds. All aspects of
			representation are controlled down even to the angle through which
			the audience views events. This limits open space in which individual
			connections are drawn. In a similar way metaphor is limited in
			application with video games. Board games, card games, and books all
			necessitate imaginative individual interpretation. These connections
			encourage individuals to develop intimate attachments with their
			physical media.</p>
		<p>Games are simulations of experience. Through systems, game
			designers seek to create emotional reactions from players through
			their interactions with the game. As games unfold players create a
			narrative event. Guided by developed framework, made unique by player
			choice, no two games provide the same narrative timeline. Games are

			owned by the individual when they place their mark on vague playspace
			created by the metaphor. Through individual interpretation of
			abstract gaming systems players become uniquely bonded with a play
			experience. This is one strength of the physical game.</p>
